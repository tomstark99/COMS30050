Check the description where it describes about "anxiety" and "depression"

1. https://www.bupa.co.uk/newsroom/ourviews/2017/10/anxiety-depression
It argues the following: 
"Around half of people with generalised anxiety disorder will also have depression. When the
conditions coexist like this, they can be more severe and long-lasting than usual."

2. https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20030305
It argues the following: 
"Anxiety and depressive disorders are among the most common psychiatric illnesses; they are highly
comorbid with each other, and together they are considered to belong to the broader category of
internalizing disorders."
  
3. https://pulsetms.com/depression-issues/
It says:
"Anxiety disorders are the most common comorbid issues linked to depression. Often, anxiety symptoms
precipitate the onset of a depressive episode. Recent studies show that up to a quarter of all
adolescents suffer from an anxiety disorder. Left untreated, these children are at high risk of
engaging in substance abuse. It is not well understood why depression and anxiety are so
frequently linked, but there are two distinct theories now widely circulated within the field of
psychiatry."

4. https://vistapineshealth.com/treatment/panic-disorders/and-depression/
It says:
“It’s not uncommon for someone with an anxiety disorder to also suffer from depression or vice
versa,” the ADAA says. “Nearly one-half of those diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with
an anxiety disorder.” It also highlights that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often co-occurs
with major depression.

# prim diag and secd_diag 

0 = none, --> not depressed 

1 = mild neurosis, 
This can be classified as depressed
check: https://www.google.com/search?q=neurosis
"a relatively mild mental illness that is not caused by organic disease, involving symptoms of stress
(depression, anxiety, obsessive behaviour, hypochondria) but not a radical loss of touch with
reality."

2 = mild GAD, 
This can be classified as depressed

	2-1. check: https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/overview/
It argues the following: 
"GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and
issues, rather than 1 specific event. People with GAD feel anxious most days and often struggle to
remember the last time they felt relaxed."

	2-2. check: 
"Many individuals with GAD startle easily. They tend to feel tired, have trouble concentrating, and may suffer from depression."

3 = OCD, 
This can be classified as depressed.
check: https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/ocd-and-depression/
"Most people with both OCD and depression report that their difficulties with OCD started before their
depressive symptoms, and this suggests that the depression occurs as a response to the distress and
devastation associated with having OCD."
  
4 = mixed anxiety and depression, 
This of course can be classified as depressed.

5 = specific phobia, 
This can be classified as depressed.
check: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/specific-phobias/symptoms-causes/syc-20355156
"Specific phobias are an overwhelming and unreasonable fear of objects or situations that pose
little real danger but provoke anxiety and avoidance."

6 = social phobia, 
This can be classified as depressed.
check: https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/social-anxiety-and-depression
"These are separate conditions, but they can co-occur, creating a unique challenge. In fact, for nearly 70 percentTrusted Source of individuals diagnosed with both disorders, social anxiety comes first, then depression. In many instances, it’s the social anxiety that causes the depression."

7 = agoraphobia, 
This can be classified as depressed.
check: https://pulsetms.com/depression/agoraphobia/
"Agoraphobia is a form of anxiety disorder, with 200,000 new diagnoses happening each year.
Characterized by an extreme fear of vast spaces and crowds, people with agoraphobia will often
isolate themselves and won’t leave their homes. In extreme, untreated cases of agoraphobia,
patients won’t leave their homes for years at a time. Leaving their homes can induce severe panic
symptoms and anxiety attacks, which can be debilitating. As is often the case with anxiety
disorders and depression, sometimes the cause of one can trigger the other, and vice versa."

8 = GAD, 
This can be classified as depressed.
See '2 = mild GAD'

9 = panic disorder, 
This can be classified as depressed.
check: https://vistapineshealth.com/treatment/panic-disorders/and-depression/

"Panic disorders can be brought on by overwhelming anxiety, and anxiety disorders are usually found
in people who are also dealing with depression. It is also common for both conditions to co-occur
when they appear. 

“It’s not uncommon for someone with an anxiety disorder to also suffer from depression or vice
versa,” the ADAA says. “Nearly one-half of those diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with
an anxiety disorder.” 

It also highlights that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often co-occurs with major depression.
According to VeryWell Mind, people with panic disorder have a greater chance of developing clinical
depression, which is the more-severe form of depression, as the Mayo Clinic explains."
