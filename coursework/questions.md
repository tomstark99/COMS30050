# Screentime notes

### what is the main goal of the project?

the goal is from the data, investigate, based on the data is there a link between screen time at age 16 and depression at age 1

variables chosen based on set of vairables from someone who investigated this question themselves. dont necessarily have to keep them all

think carefully about what to keep in and out and justify

challenge is what to keep.

### are we distinguishing what type of screen use or all into one category? (e.g. messaging or instagram)

was collected when things were different to how they were now.

There isn't as much vairablility in that data than if you did it now.

### how does privacy work on these datasets?

[link](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/research-ethics/) in the readme of how they make these ethical decisions. Have their own ethics committee if a proposal is reasonable.

### time to spend on this project?

4/5 hours per week for the duration of the project.

### phase 1 and phase 2?

the analysis of this is still being written up.
